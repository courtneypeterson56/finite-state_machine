# finite-state_machine
This program uses a FSM recognizer in order to keep track and find a specific char string within a text. 

Part A recognizes a contiguous text pattern and states where the pattern begins within the whole text.
Part B recognizes a non-contiguous text pattern and also states where it begins within the whole text.
Part C counts how many instances the pattern occurs.
Part D finds any user-inputted pattern in any user-inputted text.
