# finite-state_machine
This program uses a FSM recognizer to keep track of a char string you are searching for within a text. 

Part A recognizes a contiguous text pattern and states where it begins.
Part B recognizes a non-contiguous text pattern and also states where it begins.
Part C counts how many instances the pattern occurs.
Part D recognizes any inputted pattern in any inputted text.
