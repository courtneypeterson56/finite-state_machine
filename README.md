# finite-state_machine
This program uses a FSM recognizer to keep track of a char string you are searching for within a text. Part A recognizes a contiguous text pattern and states where it begins, Part B a non-contiguous portion and also states where it begins, and Part C counts how many instances  the pattern occurs.
